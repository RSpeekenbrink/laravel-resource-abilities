# Add abilities to Laravel API resources

If you build a web application with a separate frontend and backend, all kinds of information has to be transferred between
these two parts. Part of this are your routes, but how do you share the authorized actions in the most convenient way?
One quick note: from now on, we'll call these authorized actions "abilities". To share abilities, we use API resources. That 
way we can see the abilities the current user has for that resource.
